### Objective
  Update and edit SOFWERX's annual report, Work on the Minitaur's Battery problems, and create a Pi-based night vision camera.

### Work I Did
   This week, I updated the annual report along with Tony and Megan. I received components for the Minitaur's battery and found they worked
   as a grea solution to the low-voltage LiPo problem. I am awaiting the Pi NoIR camera, which I selected as the most effective camera
   for the K9 ISR project. 

### Meetings

   •	I met with Brian to discuss the upsides of the Pi NoIR Camera

### Summary/Remarks:
   •	Annual report complete
   •	Waiting on additional components for the Minitaur and K9 ISR Project
   •	Additional work on K9 ISR and minitaur can continue next week, as components come in

### Follow up
   •	Check on NoIR Camera and begin to program it
   •	Ensure Annual report is cleared with Tony
   •	Assist in other projects as needed
