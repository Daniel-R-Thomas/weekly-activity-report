### Big Three
- Realized there are lots of possible ways to streamline autonomous capabilities with opportunities to test out my 
(limited) LISP knowledge
- Learned that there is already autonomous code written for the driving functionality
- Decided that for cost-safe purposes, we should keep using the Jetson board, and 3D print antennas at USF's 
Nanotechnology Research (NREC) facility. 
### Objective
Clarify details of the project proposal quad chart, this was accomplished on Wednesday.
### Work I Did
Spent Tuesday and Wednesday working on learning C++ with Merryck. Other than the alarming news about the hurricane, 
this was a really effective way to learn the language. Also begain circuit design for charging station.
### Meetings
Met with Juanita and David on Thursday to discuss our next steps. These were identified as the following:
- Looking at preexisting code, finding a way to input a maintenance system for reading input and output battery voltage.
- Design Near-Field Communication (NFC) charging pads for redundancy
- Order parts and scavenge for other essential material
- Delegate tasks to Fletcher and Merryck as per David and Juanita's request
### Summary/Remarks
The next two weeks will be very busy, and I think I'm going to need to spend this weekend focused on C++ and LISPy stuff 
to keep up with the pace we're about to set. This only sucks a little because Sunday is my birthday.
### Follow-Up
Make sure Fletcher has access to the resources needed to complete tasks.
