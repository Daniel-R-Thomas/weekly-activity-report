### Big Three

- Got a consistent circuit design nailed down

- Merryck is working with me to learn the TX2

- Got a little sidetracked by some CMOS stuff, but I think we're back now with a BoM

### Objective

Finish the BoM for three possible designs to submit to Juanita

### Work I Did

I completed one of the BoMs; maybe I'm thinking about this wrong, but I don't want to get halfway through a design and then have to order more parts??


### Meetings
10/19/18 Met with Bridgette to assign her some new logistical tasks, i.e., how the rover will function without personnel intervention

### Summary/Remarks:

- My weekly activities consisted of doing a lot of antenna math to prove that some resonator circuit would be just as efficient and mutable as a ferrite core toroid, and reading documentation on inductors.

- This week seemed short, but there was a lot going on. I felt very unproductive in regards to BOUS, which is probably because a conversation with 
another engineer last week made this level of WPT seem too tricky to be feasible. 

- Finished circuit design, finished BoM, read some documentation on RF energy harvesting and CMOS application to WPT, worked with Merryck to get the Nvidia documentation to her


### Follow up

- Next week we absolutely need to request some parts
