 ### Big Three
 - Familiarized new intern Merrick Walker with project
 - 'Dog House' Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) charging concept as part of patrol route
 - Practiced C++, I'm having some trouble with function declaration
 
 ### Objective
 To design a power supply for a completely autonomous security rover. Monitoring and replacing power source is critical to functionality. The biggest obstacle the interns face right now is rectifying our lack of familiarity with the machine-learning application of this project, and getting the job done.
 
 ### Work I Did
 - Researched power supply methods
    - Read [this paper](http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1229027&dswid=-3866) and [this paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7876260) to get a better idea of the Tx/Rx interaction on a WPT system
 - Worked on the circuit design
 - Looked at possible bill of materials
 - Submitted a preliminary quad chart to Juanita
 
 ### Meetings
 (10/02/18) Met with Merryck to talk about what her role will be in this project; had her research RF circuit design. Later, brainstormed her idea for incorporating the charging station as part of the robot's patrol route, since WPT is not meant to lose time efficiency.
 ### Summary
 This week was spent getting our bearings in the process, deciding which directions we might pursue in hardware and software.
 
 ### Follow-Up
 - Will also need to simulate a regen power system, or wireless transfer to finalize bill of materials
 - Will need to generate a flowchart and project presentation with risk factors, contingencies, and solutions
