 ### Big Three
 - Realized I could modulate a data signal to a higher or lower frequency than a transmitted power signal to 
 allow for simultaneous transfer, and undamaged electronics (because rapid power transfer might be harmful to personel and 
 the behavior of onboard electronics)
 - Designed spiral loop antenna at 13.56MHz for near-field communication (to see if I could)
 - Looked at TrackingPoint Aerial Shotview before transitioning it to Space Coast Unmanned
 
 ### Objective
 For Battery Optimization for Unmanned Systems(BOUS):
 * Work effectively as a team to complete documentation on bill of materials
 * Voltage reader from TX2 using ROS:: Assigned to Fletcher
 For SmartRail:
 * Find Samsung tablet with TrackingPoint Aerial Shotview, share with Matt Colvin
 * Pursue hardware outsourced to unknown company by TrackingPoint
 For new antenna-related projects:
 * Research X-band antennas with applications to comms at 10dB
 Code skills:
 * Pointers in C++
 * 10 hour codeacademy Python course for review purposes
 * Install 'nix subsytem for Windows
 
 ### Work I did
 For BOUS:
 * Designed spiral loop antenna tuned to 13.56 MHz in ANSYS HFSS
 * Completed patent research of current wireless power transfer models for near-field communication
 * Started bill of materials for Juanita
 * Spoke often with Merryck and Juanita about potential charging systems, as well as the need for modulated frequencies,
 which is how we accomplished this week's first Big Three entry and Objective 1 for BOUS
 * Referred to Balanis text a lot for gain, aperture efficiency, and radiation efficiency help
 For SmartRail:
 * Inventoried Samsung tablet, identified TrackingPoint Aerial Shotview APK and forwarded those materials to Matt Colvin
 For new antenna projects:
 * 10dB with >90deg is very difficult to achieve, but the design process is definitely a worthwhile use of time
 For Code Skills:
 * Installed bash for 'nix subsystem (partly for my own functionality, as my laptop is about as powerful as a desktop with an Intel i5 core,
 and running a workstation is almost feasible even without a cluster as long as I stay away from ML stuff for the most part) tp transition 
 primary software development from Fletcher to me, as he has to take on several new projects and might not have time to help out as much
 * Began codeacademy's python course for review purposes
 * Programmed a min/max and range calculator based on input data in C++ (I did this last Friday after meeting with Juanita)
 
 ### Meetings 
 10/12/18 Matt Colvin came to pick up SmartRail materials (i.e. tablet, controller)
 10/16/18 Shared idea about frequency modulation with Juanita and Merryck, this idea will allow us to pursue regen power
 10/18/18 Met with Fletcher to discuss EB3 and ROS voltage checker, and the means to purchase EB3, RPi on a hat??; Fletcher will be transitioning into
 and assistive position on this project as he takes on several new efforts. This will likely push Merryck, Birdgette and I to use and hone our programming 
 literacy through practical application! 
 10/18/18 Met with Bridgette, who will be focusing on becoming our team's ROS czar
 
 ### Summary/Remarks
 * This week was focused on design for scenario-specific power transfer, i.e., not in panic mode, nonautonomous charging. 
 Renewal is critical here, but even the most autonomous of systems will rely on some element of user input. While damaging the electronics
 was a concern for me, I no longer feel it is as risky.
 * Being able to think through the process with Juanita, Merryck, and my weekly entries have been invaluable.
 * I feel that I am incredibly behind in code literacy. This is a concern for me, because my aspirations are beyond my current skillset, 
 and I feel that I will not be able to assimilate into the Sofwerx community, or any other ideal workplace environment. But David Salvador 
 had some reassuring things to say about that on 10/17/18, so I am somewhat reassured.
 
 ### Follow-up
 For SmartRail:
 * Reconnect with SmartRail effort to see the safe and efficient transition of hardware from 
 third-party to Spacecoast Unmanned 
 For BOUS:
 * Complete parts list with notes/corrections from Juanita, review with Merryck, then order parts
 * Possible PCB design in Eagle
 * Locate personal breadboard and begin physical design of stage 1 design
 * Check Bridgett's progress with ROS/C++; flow of control analogy
 For new antenna project:
 * Ask David Akers for a possible formal project description of objective for my own documentation
 Code Skills:
 * Finish python review with application to machine learning and google datasets
 * Review bash commands
