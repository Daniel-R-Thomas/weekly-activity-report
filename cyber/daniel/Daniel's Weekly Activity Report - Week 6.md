### Big Updates

- Collected locations now successfully returning images from google street view. Need API key to download these images in mass quantities. Downloaded images are being run through tensorflow and cameras are being picked up, thus a proof of concept is now established. Current time is being dedicated to report   


### Intent

The intent behind my project is to download every single street view image in a given city. After these are downloaded, object recognition will take place and identify stuff like power transformers, security cameras etc. The purpose is to be able to quickly and automatically map out an entire cities power grid or security camera locations
