### Big Three
- Reverse engineered the RadioML training template and its dataset configuration. 

- Began debugging the incorporation of the latest and richest dataset found concerning modulation types within the RadioML template.. 

- Familiarize myself with HDF5 dictionalry standard and formating.

### Objective
Develop or implement a technology which scans and classifies radio frequencies depending on the patterns and characteristics of the signal passed through them.

### Work I Did
During the current week my main goal was to utilize the current training model used and the latest RF modulation dataset to provide the richest possible model for classifying protocols.

### Meetings
 - Weekly Friday Review meeting with David
 - Weekly Friday RF Classification meeting with Team

### Follow up
- Finish the controller program which utilizes the trained model and implements the relation between modulation and protocol technologies.
