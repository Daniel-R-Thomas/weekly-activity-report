### Big Three
- Debugging and re-setup of missing and incompatible packages concerning the resources utilized. 

- Began utilizing the GNU Radio setup and RadioML repository for creating RF modulation data. 

- Team management and organization. Making sure project timeline is on track and all components of the project are understood by all members.

### Objective

Develop or implement a technology which scans and classifies radio frequencies depending on the patterns and characteristics of the signal passed through them.

### Work I Did

Initializing the proper docker environment for the repository being utilized turned out more problematic than anticipated, needed to resort to finding compatible packages which would install fully within the environment and provide a working scenario within the container. After managing to resolve most issue, I started utilizing GNU Radio and familiarizing myself how to encode static noise in the form of different modulation which later can be related to specific RF related protocols. Finally, designated tasks and answered question concerning how to operate specific components within jupyter notebook, GNU Radio and what we were trying to complete concerning the overall project.
### Meetings
 - Weekly Friday Review meeting with David
 - Weekly Friday RF Classification meeting with Team

### Follow up

- Continue testing out synthesizing RF modulation data.
