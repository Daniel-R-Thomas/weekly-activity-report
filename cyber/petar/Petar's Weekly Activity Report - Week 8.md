### Big Three
- Resolved an issue that allowed to reduce training time from 1603 secs per epoch to 33 sec per epoch by utilizing GPU integration with python 2 within the Minsky 

- Begin converting the dataset from the standard HDF5 file format to the Pickle format. 

- Review possible solution of incorporating the dataset without conversion by modifying the training and data prepation methods within the template.

### Objective
Develop or implement a technology which scans and classifies radio frequencies depending on the patterns and characteristics of the signal passed through them.

### Work I Did
With the help of Ian I was able to find a solution for utilizing the GPU hardware of Minsky while processing and implementing training algorithms within the python 2 conda environment. I also continued to review methods for reformating and reorganzing data within dictionaries and array managment techniques.

### Meetings
 - Weekly Friday Review meeting with David

### Follow up
- Continue reformatting and dataset prepartion
